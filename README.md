# Simple-Guessing-Number

#Description
This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The user specifies a numeric range, and the program randomly selects a hidden number within that range. The objective is to guess the number within 7 attempts.

As the number of remaining guesses drops below 3, the program signals to the user how many tries they have left.
